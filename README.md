## Using LTPA Based Security Check Sample
This is a sample application demonstrating the use of the [LTPA Based](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/IBM_Lightweight_Third-Party_Authentication) Security Check to protect an [IBM MobileFirst Platform](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/mobilefirstplatform) resource adapter.  This will allow your application to authenticate a user against repositories on the liberty server like [LDAP](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol).

This sample contains 4 components:  

1. [The LTPA Based Security Check](./ltpa-based-security-check) - This security check validates that the incoming request contains a valid LTPA2 cookie, and extracts the user from it.  
2. [The Resource Adapter](./HelloLTPAUserResourceAdapter) - This is the resource adapter which is protected by the LTPA Based Security Check.  
3. [The WAR project](./plain-war) - This is the WAR project which has the protected resources by Liberty / WebSphere.  
4. [The Sample Swift Application](./LTPABasedSample) - This Swift application sample calls to the resource adapter and displays an alert with "Hello {User}" after a successful authentication.  

### Prerequisites
1. Understanding the IBM MobileFirst Platform [Authentication and Security](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/authentication-and-security/).
2. Understanding the IBM MobileFirst Platform [Java Adapters](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/adapters/java-adapters/).
3. Pre-installed IBM MobileFirst Platform [development environment](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/setting-up-your-development-environment/).

### Usage
- Deploy the security check and the resource adapter:  
  - To be able to build ltpa-based adapter you will have to run the following:
   ```
   mvn install:install-file -Dfile=<MFP Install Path>/mfp-server/lib/com.ibm.websphere.security_1.0.11.jar -DgroupId=com.ibm.websphere -DartifactId=security -Dversion=1.0.11 -Dpackaging=jar
   ```
   > NOTE: version for com.ibm.websphere.security_1.0.11 jar can be different, so in such case you will have to change the path above.

   The dependency in the pom file should look like:

   ```xml
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.ibm.websphere</groupId>
      <artifactId>security</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.11</version>
      <scope>provided</scope>
   </dependency>
   ```

  - From a terminal window, navigate to the */ltpa-based* project's root folder and run the commands:  
  ```
  mfpdev adapter build
  mfpdev adapter deploy
  ```
  - Navigate to */HelloLTPAUserResourceAdapter* and run against the above commands.  

  - Your adapters are deployed now.

- Configure The LTPA Based Security Check:
  - From a terminal window run the following command:  

  ```
    mfpdev server console
  ```

  - Navigate to the *Security checks* tab and configure the `login URL`:  
    -  For *BASIC* authentication, set the login URL to point to your deployed WAR context (e.g: http://localhost:9080/plain-war).  
    -  For *FORM-BASED* authentication, set the login URL point to the FORM action (e.g: http://localhost:9080/plain-war/j_security_check).
    -  The sample by default is configured to use the *BASIC* authentication method. In order to change it to *FORM-BASED* authentication edit the following:    
      - [web.xml](./plain-war/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml) in the [plain-war](./plain-war) project.
      - [LTPAChallengeHandler.swift](./LTPABasedSample/LTPABasedSample/LTPAChallengeHandler.swift) in the [LTPABasedSample](./LTPABasedSample) XCode project.

- Install and deploy the war file:
  - From a terminal window, navigate to the *plain-war* project's root folder and run the command:
  ```
    mvn install
  ```
  - From *target* folder copy the created file *plain-war.war* into your running liberty server (you can use IBM MobileFirst Platform server for this purpose) and map it in *server.xml*.  For instance, if you copy *plain-war.war* file into *mfp-server* folder on your server, then in your *server.xml* you will need to add the following:   
  ```xml
    <server>
    .
    .
    .
    <application id="plain-war"
                 name="plain-war" location="${wlp.install.dir}/plain-war.war"
                 type="war">
        <application-bnd>
            <security-role name="AllAuthenticated">
                <special-subject type="ALL_AUTHENTICATED_USERS" />
            </security-role>
        </application-bnd>
    </application>
    .
    .
    .
    </server>
  ```  
- Register the sample app:  
  - From a terminal window, navigate to the Swift App XCode project's root folder and run:
  ```
    mfpdev app register
  ```
- Run the sample app:  
  - Open LTPABasedSample.xcworkspace

  - In the XCode project open *mfpclient.plist* and change the *host* property to `localhost` or to the domain you just configured on the security check adapter (The LTPA2 is a Cookie, so the domains need to be equals due to [Cross-site request forgery](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cross-site_request_forgery) policy)

  - You can now run the application.

  - If you are are running this sample in front of new development liberty / MFP server then the user repository can be found inside the server.xml file:

  ```xml
  <server>
    ...
    <basicRegistry>
      ...
      <user name="admin" password="admin"/>

    </basicRegistry>
  ...
  </server>
  ```

### Connecting your application to LDAP registry
Connecting to [LDAP](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol) can be done with simple configuration in server.xml. To learn more see [Configuring LDAP user registries in Liberty](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/was_beta_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/twlp_sec_ldap.html).  

For example, to be able test the connection to an [Online LDAP Test Server](http://www.forumsys.com/en/tutorials/integration-how-to/ldap/online-ldap-test-server/) you need to add the following in your liberty server.xml file:

```xml
<server>
  <featureManager>
    ...
    <feature>ldapRegistry-3.0</feature>
    ...
  </featureManager>
  ...

  <ldapRegistry baseDN="dc=example,dc=com" bindDN="cn=read-only-admin,dc=example,dc=com" bindPassword="password" port="389" host="ldap.forumsys.com" reuseConnection="false" returnToPrimaryServer="false" realm="BasicRegistry" ldapType="Custom"/>

  ...
</server>
```
